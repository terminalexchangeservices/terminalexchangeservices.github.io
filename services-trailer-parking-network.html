    	<h2>Secure Trailer Parking Services</h2>
          <p><img src="images/truck-parking-row.jpg" class="thumbpic" alt="24/7 trailer security">Our Network now provides 24/7 Secure Trailer Parking &amp; Drop Yard Services in over 596 locations throughout all of North America.  We reliably provide services to over four hundred and fifty trucking companies, logistic providers, and intermodal logistics carriers through our existing network of Secure facilities.  </p>
          <h3>Our network is growing every month! </h3>
          <p>We provide storage and parking for semi-tractors, chassis, containers, car-transporters, reefer trailers, moving vans, flatbeds, bottom dumps, tankers, cranes, step-vans and even driver's personal vehicles.</p>
          <p>Carriers and Transportation Fleets that contact Terminal Exchange Services will find yard solutions that are flexible, that eliminate costly property investment, minimize operating expenses, and stop the practice of acquiring more fixed resources than they need. </p>
          
          <p><img src="images/security-monitor-1.jpg" class="thumbpic" alt="Monitored Surveillance">By outsourcing to TXS, our clients receive increased yard services such as &quot;on-site&quot; security at a fraction of the original costs. They find that smaller fleets can be pre-positioned at more locations, servicing more lanes and thereby increasing market share.  </p>
          <h3>More Locations - Flexible, Scalable Costs</h3>
          <p>By having access to multiple facilities with flexible/scalable costs, our clients discover that TXS can provide all of the products and services most trucking companies require, but at only a fraction of the cost of maintaining their own costly (fixed cost) locations. </p>
          <p><img src="images/trailer-row.jpg" class="thumbpic" alt="scalable logistics">TXS can grow with our carriers as they grow, and can also help them reduce their footprint in any given territory, because we can make their logistics requirements scalable!  It is our mission to work as an extension of our clients' operational staffs, and to work with their drivers on site with a friendly, supportive attitude. </p>
          <p>All of our locations are within a 5 to 15 mile radius of 90 percent of the local Distribution Centers, Transportation Hubs and Corridors in that area. All of our Full Service Operations are committed to providing the services listed below.</p>
